Mining Functions:
pattern = 0 => print to 'intermediate' file with 'MINSUP_SEMIFREQ'
pattern = 1 => print to 'output' file with 'MINSUP_FREQ'
pattern = 2 => print to custom defined file with 'MINSUP_FREQ'
pattern =-2 => used in multi-port version by processes to print their itemsets

// 0: something in between
// 1: ready

Itemset representation:
{_,_,...} - First value is the starting index and the second value tells the length of the itemset. This way we can easily represent suffix projections without any sophisticated operations.
